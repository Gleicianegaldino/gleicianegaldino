## Welcome to my profile!

My name is Gleiciane Galdino and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Internet Systems at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Pernambuco. I use GitHub to share practice and study projects I undertake both inside and outside of college. I have experience with several technologies including PHP, SQL, NoSQL, MySQL, Linux, and Java, and I'm always looking to learn more.

I hope you find something useful on my profile and feel free to contact me to discuss collaborations or joint projects. Thank you for visiting!

I'm interested in web and mobile development, as well as technologies related to artificial intelligence.
